DrawTurksHead is a tool to draw... Turk's Head Knots. Try it online. It can be used as a standalone command-line application under Windows, MacOs X and Linux (probably other Unixes), and as a C++ library or Python module to integrate in your applications. I may write a graphical user interface soon, and a Java interface later.

So, what is a Turk's Head Knot? Well, I will avoid to repeat what has already been said over the web. Have a look to <a href="">wikipedia</a> and <a>[an other site]</a>. It looks like this: [two pictures of real Turk's Heads]
And DrawTurksHead draws the like this: [two pictures of drawn Turk's Heads]

Please e-mail me if you use this tool. Your e-mail can be as short or as long as you want, but let me know if you have interest in this tool and how I can improve it. I work on it on my free time, so it's important for me to have feedback.
